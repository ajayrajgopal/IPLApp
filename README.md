Frameworks Used:
Vue.js- Front End Javascript Framework
Google Charts- Data Visualization framework by Google. Used to aid in drawing various charts on the app
Firebase SDK- The Realtime Database provided by Firebase is really simple and fast to use. 
               Additionally, it provides offline caching capabilities as well which was one of the main factors.
Vuetify- A framework for Vue.js that lets you design and incorporate components with material design

Bonus Points:
Used Vue.js in order to create the web app.
	I didn't have much experience with the framework. Just some very basic knowledge. So I thought it'd be helpful if I familiarize
	myself with the framework further and go through the learning curve.
Optimize the loading time
	Lazy loads the content inside cards that helps in faster load times
Responsive Design
	I have strived to follow various material design guidelines and used cards to display the metrics and charts. This ensures more clarity and
	a simple design that'll let the user focus on the content more easily irrespective of the device they are using.
Progressive Web App
	I've been a huge fan of PWA's but had never actually got around to building one myself. With this app I managed to build my first PWA that
	can be installed by the user.
Offline Capable
	Thanks to the Firebase SDK and the PWA's caching mechanisms I was able build in some offline capabilities. The app can cache all the Player Data from visited routes.
	Players and can reload them offline. However the autocomplete search does not work offline unless the contents are loaded already. All other data is cached and can be
	view offline.
